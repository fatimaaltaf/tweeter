# 🐦Tweeter Project🐦 

Summing up your experiences in 140 characters is a skill. Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone that allows you to do just that .

I built this app using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and utilizing AJAX front-end skills. I also used Node, Express and MongoDB to practice my back-end skills.
